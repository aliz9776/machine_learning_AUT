Problem 4: Handwritten Digits Detection | KNN

a) Load the Digit dataset from scikit-learn and split it into training and test sets using a 70/30 split. Use a random seed of 42 for reproducibility.

"""Here, we can see that the training set contains 1257 instances and the test set contains 540 instances, which is a 70/30 split.

b) Preprocess the data by scaling the pixel values to the range [0, 1] using the MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn

Here, we can see that the minimum and maximum pixel values in the training set before scaling were 0.0 and 16.0 respectively, while after scaling they are 0.0 and 1.0 respectively. This confirms that the pixel values have been scaled to the range [0, 1].

c) Train a KNN classifier on the training set using K=5 and the default distance metric. Evaluate the performance of the classifier on the test set by computing the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can do it with ‘classification_report’ function.

"""The output of the code above will show the accuracy vs K graph.

Here, we can see that the average accuracy of the classifier increases initially as K increases, but then starts to plateau after around K=6. Therefore, we can use the elbow method to determine the optimal value of K, which will be the K value where the increase in accuracy starts to level off. Based on the graph, it appears that the optimal value of K is around 6 or 7.
